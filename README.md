# coffee-shop-automation
A simple coffee shop orders automation C++ program demonstrating the use of default parameters in functions.

Problem Statement:

Time for a coffee break!

You’re automating a coffee delivery system where people can order:

Coffee black (with no milk or sugar)
Coffee with milk
Coffee with sugar
Coffee with milk and sugar
It’s a bunch of options, but most of the time, people just want plain black coffee. You have a function make_coffee() built out, but it’s not efficient for people to always enter that they are NOT having milk or sugar… So what are you to do?

Default arguments to the rescue! Add default arguments of false to the parameters of make_coffee() in coffee.hpp.
